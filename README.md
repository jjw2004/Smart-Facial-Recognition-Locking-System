# Smart Facial Recognition Locking System
#### Student Name: John Joey Wright   Student ID: 20105823

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an IoT-based smart locking system using facial recognition. A Raspberry Pi will serve as the central hub, capturing images of individuals attempting to unlock the lock. If the detected face matches a registered user, the lock will unlock; otherwise, access will be denied. Additionally, an automatic light will turn on in low-light conditions to assist the camera. The system will utilize Azure AI for facial recognition and decision-making, with status messages displayed on an LCD screen.

## Tools, Technologies, and Equipment
- **Hardware:**
  - Raspberry Pi
  - Raspberry Pi Camera Module
  - Light Sensor (LDR)
  - Relay Module (for door lock)
  - Very Powerful LED Light
  - LCD Display (16x2 or OLED)
  - Grove Hat attachment (for attaching the different sensors to the Raspberry Pi)
  
- **Software & Cloud Services:**
  - Python (for programming logic)
  - Azure Cognitive Services (for facial recognition processing)
  - MQTT (for IoT communication)   <!-- honestly not sure if i need this yet but ill put it here for now -->
  - GitHub (for version control and publication)
  - Some sort of editing software for the video
